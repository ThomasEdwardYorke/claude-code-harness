Claude Code enforces the decision
```

> **Exception — `WorktreeCreate` blocking hook**: unlike every other event,
> `WorktreeCreate` fully **replaces** Claude Code's default `git worktree add`
> behavior. It follows the official *command* hook contract (see
> <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks>) — on success it prints the raw
> absolute worktree path to stdout (no JSON envelope), and any non-zero exit
> causes worktree creation to fail. The dispatcher (`scripts/hook-dispatcher.mjs`)
> and `core/src/index.ts main()` both have a `worktree-create` branch that
> honors this blocking contract end-to-end; all other events continue to use
> the JSON-decision protocol shown above.

## Layers

1. **Guardrails** — 13 declarative rules. Domain-neutral defaults plus 3
   parameter-driven rules (R10 / R11 / R13) that can be enabled per project.
2. **Skills** — 5 verb commands (`plan` / `work` / `review` / `release` /
   `setup`) that live under `commands/`.
3. **Agents** — 3 general-purpose agents (`worker` / `reviewer` /
   `scaffolder`) plus 2 helpers (`security-auditor`, `codex-sync`).
4. **State** — pure-JS JSON file at `<projectRoot>/.claude/state/harness.json`.
   No native SQLite. Single-process safe.

## Configuration precedence

1. `harness.config.json` at the project root — user-authored values
2. `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `core/src/config.ts` — applied for any unset field
3. Environment variables (`HARNESS_WORK_MODE`, `HARNESS_CODEX_MODE`,
   `HARNESS_BREEZING_ROLE`) override narrow flags at evaluation time

Unknown fields in `harness.config.json` are ignored (forward compatibility).

## Design invariants

- Plugin root paths are resolved via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. The dispatcher
  never uses `../../` or ad-hoc traversal — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/dist/…`
  is always valid post-install.
- Every rule evaluates a `RuleContext` that carries the loaded `HarnessConfig`.
  Empty config arrays mean "off", never "error".
- Every hook path **except `WorktreeCreate`** fails open on errors. A
  malformed input JSON or a missing core build approves the tool call rather
  than blocking the user. `WorktreeCreate` is the one event whose official
  contract is **blocking** (raw stdout + non-zero exit fails worktree
  creation); the dispatcher `failOpen()` routine has a `worktree-create`
  special case that writes the failure to stderr and exits 1 so the
  end-to-end contract is preserved even when the dispatcher itself fails
  (e.g. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` unset, `core/dist` missing).

## Official reference patterns used

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest
- `hooks/hooks.json` — per-tool matchers (one entry per tool to avoid
  relying on unverified regex-OR behaviour)
- `bin/` — `harness` CLI added to the Bash `PATH` while the plugin is enabled
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — plugin install directory

See the Claude Code plugin reference for the canonical definitions.
